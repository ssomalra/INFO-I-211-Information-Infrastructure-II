## Final Project 
The COVID-19 pandemic incited changes in almost every aspect of modern-day living and its impacts have continued to remain prominent to this day. Starting in late 2019, the disease was first recognized and a worldwide outbreak had begun by the beginning of 2020. People were forced to stay inside their homes and turn to online entertainment to cure their boredom. In 2020, at the peak of the pandemic in the U.S., Netflix subscribers streamed over 203 million hours per day. With this swarm of new viewers, there was an increased demand for streaming services, like Netflix and Hulu, and these streaming services needed to meet the demand. Using dataset “Netflix Movies and TV Shows” (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows), the Netflix trends can be explored over the progression of the pandemic.
